Purpose

A turnkey AI observability stack for LLM/RAG systems: standardized OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs for prompts, tokens, costs, retrieval performance, and agent/tool spans—plus dashboards, SLOs, and ready-to-copy alert rules.

Outcomes (Executive)

End-to-end visibility and cost transparency for AI features.

Faster RCA: from minutes → seconds with span linking across embed/retrieve/rerank/generate.

Compliance-friendly logs with PII redaction and sampling.

Scope
Features

Instrumentation SDK (Python/Node): span helpers for embed, retrieve, rerank, generate, tool_call; attributes: model, tokens, cost, latency, cache-hit, top-k, filters.

RAG Metrics: hit@k proxy, recall estimator, retrieval latency histograms, reranker impact.

Cost Accounting: per-request/per-tenant counters; burn-rate panels by model/provider.

Dashboards: RAG Overview, LLM Backend, Cost & Budgets, Agent/Tools, Error Taxonomy.

Alerting: p95 latency breach, error burst, cost burn > threshold, retrieval miss spike.

PII/Secrets: redactors + structured sampling; secure retention policies.

Exporters: OTLP to Tempo/Jaeger + Prometheus + Loki; turnkey docker-compose and Helm.

Non-Functional

Overhead: SDK adds <5% latency; sampling configurable.

Security: No raw prompts in logs by default; masked fields list.

Portability: Works with any LLM provider; adapters for OpenAI/Anthropic/self-hosted.

Architecture

Client libs → OTel Collector → Prometheus/Grafana + Tempo/Jaeger + Loki.

Optional export to Datadog/New Relic/OpenSearch for enterprise users.

Deliverables

sdk/ (client libraries with examples)

dashboards/ (Grafana JSON, pre-wired)

alerting/ (rules for Prometheus/Alertmanager)

deploy/ (docker-compose for local; Helm/Kustomize for K8s)

docs/ (integration guide, redaction, SLO cookbook, runbook)

Acceptance Tests

Sample app shows linked spans across all stages with cost/tokens.

Alerts fire on synthetic p95/error/cost spikes; dashboards reflect in <1 min.

Redaction verified: secrets never emitted; sampled payloads scrubbed.

Roadmap (6–8 weeks)

W1–2: SDK + minimal sample app; spans/attrs defined.

W3: Dashboards + alerts + docs.

W4–5: Cost/burn-rate, hit@k proxy, reranker deltas.

W6–7: Helm chart + enterprise exporters + redaction policies.

W8: Hardening; “integration in 15 minutes” guide.

Resume Bullets

Built a GenAI observability platform with standardized OTel semantics for prompts, tokens, cost, and retrieval, cutting RCA time by 60%.

Shipped drop-in SDKs and Grafana packs enabling org-wide SLOs for LLM latency/cost and agent/tool workflows.

Parallel Build Guidance (so you don’t lose focus)

Primary track (Month 1): genai-observability-suite (smallest surface, high recruiter impact).

Secondary (Month 1–2): cloud-finops-toolkit ingestion + allocation + dashboards.

Tertiary (Month 2–3): mlops-pipeline-starter minimal CT/CD + canary; deepen later.

Each repo gets:

docs/architecture.md, docs/runbook.md, docs/decisions/*.md (ADRs)

dashboards/*.json with screenshots in README

CI: build + scan (Trivy/Semgrep) + sign (Cosign) + SBOM
